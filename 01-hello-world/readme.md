```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

- You need to include it in order to read or write to the standard input/output streams,
- That program will not compile unless you add #include <iostream>
- This is like a configuration option for c++ programs

---

```c++
int main()
```

- a function in c++ (container to put our code)

---

```c++
#include <iostream> //header file library
using namespace std; //using standard library

int main() { //main function
  cout << "Hello World \n"; // first object
  cout << "Learn C++ \n\n"; //second object with blank line
  cout << "Jericho"; //third object
  return 0; //no other output or return
} //end of code to exectute
```
